2.py,3.py,4.py are the exact same files as pin1play2.py,pin1play4.py,pin1play4.py
but just renamed for ease of use for ssh.
2.py runs an ssh into another pin and synchronizes it with a video played on the pin itself.
3.py runs a video on the pin
4.py is similar to 2.py but on a different rpi
to ssh into a new pin we need to use command line to ssh into that pin first to ensure that they recognize each other.

The ble feature can also be used however we need to follow the instruction in the ble folder.
